This repository contains a JavaScript code example demonstrating a common error in JavaScript functions: improper handling of null or undefined arguments. The bug.js file showcases the flawed code, while bugSolution.js offers a corrected version.  The bug involves an incorrect assumption about null values in arithmetic operations.  The solution demonstrates how to handle such cases gracefully, either by providing default values or throwing an appropriate error.
